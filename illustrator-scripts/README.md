===================

This is a collection of scripts that you might find useful when working in Illustrator as your main drawing tool for assets included in your various programming projects.

iOS-Export-Icons.jsx
====================

A quick and dirty script for exporting your square iOS icons into all of the possible Apple-recommended sizes at once. Extremely useful in those situations where someone keeps asking you to "tweak" the icons "just a little bit" and want to see each tweak on an actual device.
