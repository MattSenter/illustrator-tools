As an example, you generally need to have a 57x57 and 72x72 icon * for iPhone and iPad respectively. On top of that you need the retina versions * at twice the size. Files are exported using the prescribed Apple names. *//* * Here is our list of icons to export. These are the standard Apple icons used * in various places throughout the Apple ecosystem.
